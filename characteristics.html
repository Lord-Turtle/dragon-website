			The idea of what a dragon looks like has almost become synonymous with everyday life no matter where in the world you go if you ask someone to describe how a dragon 
			looks they will almost give you the exact same answer.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Teeth</h4>
		<p>
			Dragon teeth have always been described as long fangs sometimes exceeding past mouth and being visible even when the mouth is closed. there is a possibility that they 
			also had molars so they could crush rocks to get the precious metals out of them but these are never seen in any depections of dragons.
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<h4>Claws</h4>
		<p>
			The claws of a dragon are always shown to be long, big and sharp almost like the talons of an eagle creating a very threatning look. the only thing different is the 
			amount of claws per foot.
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<h4>skin</h4>
		<p>
			The skin of a dragon is alwas described as having scales covering its body. in some cultures they have an exact amount of scales with more positive scales representing 
			yang and less negative scales representing yin.
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<h4>head</h4>
		<p>
			the head of a dragon does vary a bit from culture to culture but the general shape of seems to stay the same being compared to the head of a snake, horse, crocodile and
			aligator.
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<h4>Tail</h4>
		<p>
			The tail of the dragon always seems to stay the same being of a long length covered in scales and sometimes has a spike at the end of it
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<h4>Wings</h4>
		<p>
			amusingly the one part of a dragon that people in western countries most associate with dragons is the one thing in most asian countries that their dragons do not have.
			in western cultures the dragon is described as having at least one pair of wings that has a thin membrane on them like a bat and is of a proportionate size. however in 
			eastern culture their dragons ever have no wings at all or very small wing that seem to be more for decoration than functionality
