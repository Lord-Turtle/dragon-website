		<h2>The possibilities</h2>
		<p>
			The possibilities of the mythical powers of dragons almost seem to be mythical. However there is real world creatures that posses some of these features. <br>
			The possible realities I will address are the following:
		<!----------------------list of possibilities--------------------------->
			<br>Fire Breathing
			<br>Flight
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<!-----------------------fire breath----------------------------------->
		<h3>Fire Breath</h3>
		<p>
			Although it seems very unlikely for any creature to possess this power there is a beetle called the bombardier beetle that has this power exact power to spray a liquid
			that combusts at its enemys. In this section I will try to explain how this mythical creature could have made something of almost mythical stance become a realistic
			possibility. I will be doing this by talking about 
			<br>Hydrogen bladders 
			<br>internal temprature 
			<br>magic
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Hydrogen bladders</h4>
		<p>
			The idea that a creature would purposefuly have a bladder filled with a flamable gas just so it could ignite it does at first glance seem to be trying to make something
			from nothing.
			<br>However this is more of a realistic possibility than it may look as dragons are known for thier carnivorous nature the flesh inside their stomachs would release many
			different types of gasses including hydrogen and methane, if dragons had another bladder they could store this in it would give the dragon a sauce of fuel. If the 
			dragons ate rocks to help with thier digestion like dinosuars, crocodiles and aligators do and if they knew to get rock with with precious metals in it such as titanium 
			then the metals left in thier mouths would react with the fuel(hydrogen) and create a jet of fire as it leaves the body.

		<h4>Internal temperature</h4>
		<p>
			The is many things still not certain about dragons especially how they work on the inside, many people seem to have a different opinion about how they work.
			<br>One of the ways people believe dragons can breath fire is because they naturaly have an extremly high temperature inside of them. This would account for a dragons
			naturally hot breath. This could mean that instead of breathing fire like you would expect them to but instead have a breath so hot it could set things a light and melt 
			other material, this could let to the myth of dragons breathing fire.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Magic</h4>
		<p>
			In Korean mythology there is a giant orb called a yeouiju that contains unimaginable power inside of it that can be used at will by anyone or anything that can weild it.
			<br>Knowing this is it possible that dragons used this to grant themselves the use of fire breath. Could it be however something even greater and that dragons have magical
			powers inbeded inside of them and are just born with it.
		</p>
		<br><br><br>
		
		<h3>Flight</h3>
		<p>
			The capability of flight in it self is not of a mythical status. However for a animal the size and shape of a dragon the physics of this wouldn't support the capability 
			of flight.<br>
			there are few way that this could be considered possible, these are:
			<!---------------------------------list of flight options------------------------------------------>
			<!-----by using brakes instead of a list I am able to have it without bullet points or numbers----->
				<br>Bladders full of hydrogen
				<br>Internal temperature
				<br>Bumble bees
				<br>Magic
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<!------------------------------flight options------------------------------>
		<h4>Bladders full of hydrogen</h4>
		<p>
			Research says their is an upper limit for a flying creture and that a dragon would exceed these limits.
			<br>However if a dragon had a bladder or bladders full of hydrogen then the capability of flight is considerably more in thier favor, Since hydrogen is 14 times lighter
			than air. This could happen due to dragons being carnivorous as the fleash decomposes inside thier stomach it produces hydrogen gas, then it could be transfered somehow 
			to another bladder allowing them to become lighter.
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<h4>Internal temperature</h4>
		<p>
			The possibility of flight for a dragon almost seems to be grounded due to thier size.
			<br> it is well known that hot things rise this is because as things get hotter they expand and become less dense than the samething at a colder temperature. Using this 
			logic we could understand that if the internals of a dragon especially the lungs that are filled with air, then they might be able to create enough bouyancy to create lift 
			with thier wings.
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<h4>Bumble bees</h4>
		<p>
			The idea that a bumble bee can fly seems like it would just be a thing of life like trees flowering or dogs barking. However the bumble bee has been studied and
			researchers are unclear on how a bumble bee can fly to having wings to small for the weight of them.<br>
			This is good news for dragons what have the same problem also, even the european dragons that have the biggest wing size out of all dragons. Could there be some 
			unknown forces acting on thesse creatures that allow them to fly by defying physics, is thier a deity that has smiled upon them and granted them the gift of flight,
			 is it magic that both bumble bees and dragons can defy physics or is it something more realistic and that we just haven't figured out what really makes them fly. 
			No matter what the situation is it gives hope that like the humble bumble bee a dragon could also fly with disproportionate wings to body ratio, if dragons did exist.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Magic</h4>
		<p>
			In Korean mythology there is a giant orb called a yeouiju that contains unimaginable power inside of it that can be used at will by anyone or anything that can weild it.
			<br>Knowing this it could explain how dragons of asian decent are capable of flying with either no wings or small wings, even european dragons with giant wings aren't 
			big enough to lift thier bodies could they have also had this orb hidden within them or is magic just part of them and have no need for magical orbs to preform magic.
