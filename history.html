		<h2>About the history</h2>
		<p>
			The history of dragons is a long and complex path with many countries having some form of presence either in thier religion and/or thier folklore.<br>
			to say that dragons are have a place in history is an understatement, with many countries making dragons almost a stapple point of thier past, 
			for instance the flag of England represents the red cross on a white background what St George wore when he killed the dragon.<br>
			On this page I have put together different histories from all over the world all about dragons.

		<h4>European</h4>
		<p>
			The European dragon is probably the most iconic and easily recogninsed myhtical creature represented in movies, books and story telling.<br> 
			The oldest recognizable image of a "modern-style" western dragon appears in a hand-painted illustration from the bestiary MS Harley 3244, which was produced in around 
			1260. Dragons are prominent in medieval heraldry. Uther Pendragon was famously said to have had two gold dragons crowned with red standing back-to-back on his royal coat
			of arms. Originally, heraldic dragons could have any number of legs, but, by the late Middle Ages, due to the widespread proliferation of bestiaries, heraldry began to 
			distinguish between a "dragon" (with four legs) and a "wyvern" (with two legs). In Western folklore, dragon-like creatures and dragons in Christian literature are 
			usually portrayed as evil, except mainly in Asturian and Welsh folklore and modern fiction. In the modern period and late medieval times.

		<h4>Chinese</h4>
		<p>
			in Chineese mythology the Chinese dragon is considered a symbol strength and goodluck.
			<br>The presence of dragons within Chinese culture dates back several thousands of years with the discovery of a dragon statue dating back to the fifth millennium BC 
			and continued to be the symbol of the emperor for many dynasties. The Chinese dragon was featured on the first Chinese national flagIt was featured again on the Twelve 
			Symbols national emblem, which was used during the Republic of China, from 1913 to 1928.			
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<h4>Japanese</h4>
		<p>
			Japanese dragon myths combine native legends with imported stories about dragons from China, Korea and India. The style of the dragon was heavily influenced by the 
			Chinese dragon.
			<br>In 680AD was when the first Japanese textual references to dragons arrived. When Buddhist monks from other parts of Asia brought their faith to Japan they 
			transmitted dragon and snake legends from Buddhist and Hindu mythology. During World War II, the Japanese military named many armaments after Chinese dragons. The Kōryū 
			"flood dragon" was a midget submarine and the Shinryū "spirit dragon" was a rocket kamikaze aircraft. An Imperial Japanese Army division, the 56th Division, was 
			codenamed the Dragon Division. Coincidentally, the Dragon Division was annihilated in the Chinese town of Longling, whose name means "Dragon's Tomb".
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<h4>Korean</h4>
		<p>
			Ancient texts sometimes mention sentient speaking dragons, capable of understanding complex emotions such as devotion, kindness, and gratitude.
			<br>The rulers of the Joseon dynasty wore dragon robes to symbolize their power. The color and emblems had different meanings. For example, the king wore a scarlet robe 
			depicting a dragon with 5 claws (representing the emperor), while the crown prince wore an emblem with a four-clawed dragon.
