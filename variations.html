		<h2>Variations</h2>
		<p>
			As the idea dragons have been around for thousands of years over the world the idea of what a dragon looks and behaves like is found to be different.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		
		<h3>European variations</h3>
		<p>
			The European dragon maybe the most iconic type of dragon ever but with that popularity comes diversity.<br>
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Wyvern</h4>
		<p>
			The Wyvern has become a rather popular variation in recent times due to tv and movies. <br>
			The Wyvern is known for having only two legs  unlike the common four legged dragon. They do have the ability to breath fire however being more 
			animalistic in nature this is not one of thier more common abilities. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Classic European dragon</h4>
		<p>
			The classic European dragon has been well known for many hundreds of years and has been told in many different ways from them being gentle creatures who want to help 
			people to giant breathing monsters bound on destroying anything in its path.<br>
			The classic European dragon is most commonly made to be a giant four legged two winged dragon with scales all over and a long tail. The classic European dragon is most 
			commonly seen breathing fire as its main form of defense and attack and is been known to have an affliation with shiny objects mainly gold. it is unknown if this 
			creature can talk but seems to be on a case to case situation, either way they are known to have great intellects and have been sought out for thier wisdom and knowledge. 
		</p>
		
		
		
		<br>
				
		<h4>Drake</h4>
		<p>
			The Drake is a more modern variation of a dragon only properly being made into its on varaiation in the 13<sup>th</sup> century.
			The Drake is described as having the body, head, four legs and tail of a dragon but has no wings.being such a modern variation not a lot is known about Drakes what is 
			known about them is that they can breath fire just like other variations however besides this not a lot is known about thier behaviour or abilities.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		
		<h3>Asian variations</h3>
		<p>The Asian variations are also some of the most iconic creatures and in someways silmilar to their European counterparts but with their own differences</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Chinese dragon</h4>
		<p>
			The Chinese dragon is considered a symbol of power, strength and good luck in chinese culture and people who are considered outstanding are often refered to dragons 
			in Chinese culture. <br>
			The Chinese dragon (sometimes known as lung/long dragon) has been known to take many different forms such as fish or turtles but is mainly seen as a serpent creature 
			with four legs unlike most European versions the Chinese dragon is often seen to have control over water such as rainfall, typhoons and floods but has other potent and  
			auspicious powers, and is not seen as a aggresive creature like its European counterpart but as a spiritual and cultural symbol representing prosperity and goodluck 
			however later on it is believed that some of these dragons turned mischevious and caused flooding if a mortal had upset them.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Japaneese dragon</h4>
		<p>
			The Japaneese dragon is much like the Chinese dragon about every aspect possible having merged thier myths throughout history this is not surprising.<br>
			The Japaneese dragon is in apparence the exact same as the Chinese dragon being described as a large serpent like creature with four legs and the face of 
			a horse/crocodile with no wings and and claws on its feet. However one key difference to note is that while the Chinese do see thier dragons as a kind and spiritual 
			creatures the Japaneese don't always see them like this and some have been known to have the sole purpose of destruction set on thier minds.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Korean dragon</h4>
		<p>
			The Korean dragon is in most parts like the Chinese and Japaneese counterparts but with some key differences that make them thier own creature.<br>
			The Korean dragon is in most parts identical to the Chinese and Japaneese dragons having a serpent like body with four legs, a head of a horse/crocodile, feet with 
			claws and no wings but they do differ by having a longer beard and sometimes carrying an orb in its feet or mouth known as a yeouiju this orb has unlimited power and 
			potential but only the four toed dragon were capable of holding such orbs as they were considered wise and poweful enough to do so unlike the three toed dragons what 
			werent considered to be as wise or powerful to hold such power orbs. The korean dragons are often seen as being related to water and agriculture and are said to be 
			bringers of rain and clouds and live in the water such as lakes, rivers or oceans.
